# Sentiment Analysis React App

This is a Simple sentiment analysis react application. 

A user enters input and the application will determine if it is negative, neutral, or positive. It will then assign a score to the input and display an image based on the sentiment
score. This app is primarily being used as a jumping point for the Chat-Sentiment-Analysis application for the Truffle extension hackathon.
